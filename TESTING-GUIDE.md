# KnowledgeScout Advanced Q&A Test Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **What I've Implemented for the Best Answers:**

### **1. Intelligent Query Analysis**
- **Intent Detection**: Automatically detects what type of answer you want
  - `definition` - "What is...", "Define...", "Explain..."
  - `types` - "Types of...", "Categories of...", "Different kinds..."
  - `examples` - "Examples of...", "Give me examples..."
  - `applications` - "Where is... used?", "Applications of..."
  - `how` - "How does... work?", "Process of..."

### **2. Enhanced Relevance Scoring**
- **Exact Match Bonus**: Exact word matches get 4x higher scores
- **Intent-Based Scoring**: Different scoring for different question types
- **Context Awareness**: Considers paragraph structure and content type
- **Length Optimization**: Balances completeness with conciseness

### **3. Smart Answer Generation**
- **Definition Questions**: Provides clear definitions with context
- **Type Questions**: Lists multiple types/categories
- **Example Questions**: Gives comprehensive examples
- **General Questions**: Combines best chunks for complete answers

### **4. Improved Chunking**
- **Paragraph-Based**: Maintains semantic meaning
- **Optimal Size**: 400 characters for comprehensive yet focused answers
- **Better Overlap**: 100 characters for context continuity
